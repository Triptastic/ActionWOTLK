# GGL WOTLK

Trip's Basic Series: entry-level rotations for Wrath of the Lich King, designed to get you by until more advanced rotations come along from developers who actually know what they're doing. 

# These were created at the start of WoTLK. Only Rogue has been recently updated. I am releasing these as open-source for all.
