Trip's Basic Series: entry-level rotations for Wrath of the Lich King, designed to get you by until more advanced rotations come along from developers who actually know what they're doing. 

# These are now outdated. I have moved to obfuscating my code. These will remain here as a resource for other people who wish to learn how to create their own rotations.
